## MailChimp Advanced Features

- [ ] `#later` it would be ideal if we can also connect the e-mail to user-data (pixel and other trackers, ad segment) and actual in-app data (if we also track a user there with the same trackers). This is definitely possible. I can tag whatever I want and they have an API and Zapier integrations so there's many possibilities to connect in-app events to a mail account. Maybe I can even build my own site to app connector, based on device info, ip, time, geo-location, whatever.
- [ ] `#later` it would also be necessary to be able to tag payments information with [rcur](https://rcur.nl)
- [ ] also, a tag for when a user that churned after putting in the email, should be noted.
- [ ] retargeting after a user downloaded the app but didn't do much with it. with tags I can basically know if a user is active and how much the user uses the app. However, this is probably easier to do from firebase... I don't know... I think I should just try...

This technique can be used to do this.

### Personalization

The https://unless.com/ idea. Brilliant.

### Add more Sections and possibilities `#toPlan #later`

These are all only interesting in later stages, when there are already active users, and money is coming in.

## TypeScript

Make it possible to automatically check whether or not the types are correct. This is better to do when we migrate to Expo Web (This can be SDK 33 or SDK 34)
